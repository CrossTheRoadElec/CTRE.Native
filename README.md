# CTRE.Native
HERO NETMF bindings for native routines.  These are primarily meant to wrap firmware features in the HERO so they can be used in C#.

This repository is primarly useful for documenting how the bindings API works, particularly the [CAN bus interface](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/CTRE.Native/blob/master/Native.cs#L17).
